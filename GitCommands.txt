Git Workflow :

Clone the project from Git Remote repo --> Git local repo.
git clone <link>

New files are created/old files updated, add these files in git staging area.
git add <filename> -- for single file
git adf . --> for adding all the files.

After staging the changes, commit all those changes
git commit -m "commit message"

After commit push the git local repo to remote repo
git push origin main

//Here origin means the remote repo that we are meaning to push to and main refers to branch, not only origin it could be any other name but by default when we create a repo in git hub, it is named origin
